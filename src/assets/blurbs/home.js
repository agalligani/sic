      At Terrat Interiors, decisions about design are taken with an eye towards
      modern luxury and comfort. While keeping things contemporary, we take
      inspiration from the masters of mid-century modern and Bauhaus design. The
      lifelong passion of Drew Terrat for crafting elegant spaces for exclusive
      clients up and down the East Coast has earned Mr. Terrat a reputation for
      meticulously curated furnishings.

      `When done right, interior design becomes an intimate component in the
      fabric of our lives and of those with whom we share the experience of
      living. The choices we make in building, furnishing or renovating our
      homes are some of the most important decisions we will ever make. Ensuring
      that a space is both aesthetically pleasing and functional will bring joy
      and pleasure to daily existence. A statement about personal values and
      identity, a living space is a reflection of how we see ourselves as well
      as one of the primary sources of happiness and personal contentment. `

      Through the years he has won many awards, but much of his best work is no
      longer gracing the covers or style sections of magazines. Many of Drew's
      exclusive clients don't open their doors to share their homes with
      photographers. And it's just as well. Our passion isn't for awards or
      glossy layouts (although we aren't knocking it... we love these too!).
